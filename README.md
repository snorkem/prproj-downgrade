# prproj_downgrade
Simple script for downgrading Adobe Premiere Pro project files to version 1. Tested on Macs only at this time.
Downgraded files should be able to open with any version of Premiere.

The script should install any non-standard modules automatically, if not detected when you run it for the first time. Written for Python 3.5+.
